<!-- ACADEMIC OUTCOMES -->

## Academic Outcome

"You've been hired as a backend developer at a new startup called WeLoveMovies. As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, you have been tasked with setting up a database and building out specific routes so that users can gain access to data about movies, theaters, and reviews."

- Install and use common middleware packages
- Receive requests through routes
- Run tests from the command line
- Access relevant information through route and query parameters
- Create an error handler for the case where a route doesn't exist
- Build an API following RESTful design principles
- Create and customize a knexfile.js file
- Create a connection to your database with Knex
- Write database queries to complete CRUD routes in an Express server
- Return joined and nested data with Knex
- Write database migrations using Knex's migration tool
- Deploy your backend server to a cloud service

### Requirements to Pass:
- All the tests are passing in Qualified.
- The migrations can be correctly run and rolled back.
- The seed command can be run multiple times and will work correctly.
- A response is included for Method Not Allowed.
- The cors package is included.
- The backend application is deployed and working
